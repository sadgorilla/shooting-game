# shooting-game

game where you shoot waves of targets

WASD to move
mouse to aim/shoot

things to add:
- in-game timer
- advanced scoring (combo counter, distance traveled by bullet)
- summon mines on edge for higher points
- in-game setting to change size of mines
- headshots
- different guns (bullet speed, firerate, size?)
- restrict movement to up/down
- stop player movement when no key is pressed

end goal is something like the last stand flash game from armorgames
